# Cuneiform Geography

Each cuneiform tablet has a provenience, or place of discovery. Sometimes this information is lost due to illicit digging and the lack of documentation, but when it is known, this data has been published in the open source databases of cuneiform texts, most notably: [CDLI](https://cdli.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/), [ORACC](oracc.museum.upenn.edu), and [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es/).
In 2021 a team of specialists published a dataset of proveniences for the cuneiform sources in Zenodo, entitled [Cuneiform Inscriptions Geographical Site Index](https://zenodo.org/record/5642899#.YxeO1uzMLy9). Their data curation extended beyond that of the existing databases, and has become the dataset of record for geographical metadata for these artifacts, and has since been included in the CDLI.

The goal of this initial notebook is (1) to access this dataset using reproducible methods, and compare previous and current versions, and lastly (2) to prepare this data for Linked Open Data (LOD) triple statements in the [FactGrid Cuneiform Project](https://database.factgrid.de/wiki/FactGrid:Cuneiform_Project).
